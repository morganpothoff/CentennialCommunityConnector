	<h2>About</h2>
	<p> 
		With our new services, we aim to bring you to a better state of living, with community events organized directly in your area and quick ways to connect with mental health professionals.
		<br>
		<br>
		View upcoming community events in your area, or let us know if you want to host an event yourself. We'll provide you with the help and resources you need.
		<br>
		<br>
		We are also providing robust options for counseling. You can directly search for support groups and psychologists in your area, and we'll help you access these resources. If you want to organize your own support group, we also have an option for that. Additionally, you may attend anonymous, online counseling if you are not comfortable with presenting yourself.
		<br>
		<br>
		To kick off the centennial event, we will also have 100 cities host events with mental health professionals to make it easier to find someone who is a good fit for you, teach attendees about mental health, and how to spot the signs and get someone help.
