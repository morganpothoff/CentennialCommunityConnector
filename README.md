# CentennialCommunityConnector
A State Farm event providing service that assists its communities and individual clients by connecting communities to advocate for mental health.


## User Story
As a mental health advocate, I want a way to request State Farm to host events in my community,<br/>
So that I can meet in-network counselors in my area.


## About
To kick off the centennial event, we will have 100 cities host events with mental health professionals to make it easier to find someone who is a good fit for each individual, teach people about mental health, and how to spot the signs and get someone helo

In the future, we hope to have SF host more events to teach people about specific issues and continue their support of America like a good neighbor.
